A simple click to switch between custodial wallet and non-custodial wallet for your convenience.",
    "Every": "Every time you send any cryptocurrency, from your address to another, you incur a Network Transaction fee, also referred to as a Network fee. Making trades on exchanges also requires fees for every 'buy' or 'sell' transaction. The actual fee you pay will vary according to the network you use. For example, a Bitcoin transaction will have a different fee in comparison to transactions placed on the Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum or Litecoin network.",
    "Due": "Due to the decentralized nature of crypto assets, such transactions cannot be reversed; therefore lost or stolen funds cannot be recovered.",
    "Besides": "Besides the necessary network gas fees, all other features of Cwallet like send, receive, swap, bots, and tools do not charge any extra fees. It’s an absolutely FREE crypto wallet and available for all crypto holders and traders."
